Progressive File Downloader with Range Requests
This project provides a JavaScript implementation of a progressive file downloader that utilizes Range Requests to efficiently download large files in segmented chunks. The downloader is designed to enhance the download experience by allowing users to access partially downloaded content while the download is in progress.

Features
Segmented Downloads: The downloader breaks down large files into smaller segments, allowing for faster and more reliable downloads. By downloading the file in chunks, it minimizes the impact of network interruptions and facilitates resumable downloads.

Customizable Variables: The code includes configurable variables such as file URL, start byte, and end byte, enabling users to customize the download range according to their specific requirements. This flexibility allows for targeted downloads of specific parts of the file or parallel downloading of multiple segments.

Robust Error Handling: The downloader incorporates comprehensive exception handling to gracefully handle various scenarios. It provides informative error messages and fallback mechanisms in case of server errors, network failures, or other unexpected situations, ensuring a smooth and uninterrupted download process.

Custom Headers: The code supports the inclusion of custom headers in each Range Request sent to the server. This enables the use of authentication tokens, authorization mechanisms, or any other necessary headers to ensure secure and authorized downloads.

Progressive Download Support: The downloader facilitates progressive downloading, enabling users to access and utilize partially downloaded content while the download is still ongoing. This feature is particularly useful for streaming large media files or working with files that are too large to download as a single unit.

Modular and Extensible Design: The code is structured in a modular and extensible manner, making it easy to integrate into existing projects or extend its functionality. The modular design promotes code reusability and allows for easy customization to meet specific project requirements.

Usage
Clone the repository or download the source code to your local machine.

Install any necessary dependencies as outlined in the project's documentation.

Customize the variables in the code according to your desired download parameters, such as the file URL, start byte, and end byte.

Run the code to initiate the progressive file download using the specified parameters.

For detailed instructions on how to use the downloader and additional configuration options, please refer to the project's documentation.
